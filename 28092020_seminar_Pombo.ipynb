    "What we know about the structure of the nucleus is a result of microscopy and molecular methods for capturing spatial organization of the genome, e.g., chromatin conformation capture (3C)\n",
    "\n",
    "But, these methods have limitations; genome architectsure mapping (GAM) is the first genome-wide method for capturing 3-D proximities between genomic loci without ligation and overcomes some limitations of 3C"

    "\n",
    "* *PhD trains you to make ideas into reality. Need to discover if we can have ideas or not... not something that comes for free. Through brainstorming with peers and colleagues develop ideas. Even if you aren't so creative, you can find a place in science (editors, lab researcher (maybe not group leader), etc.)*\n",

    "After PhD, did a fellowship at Oxford through Oriel College, then received a more prestigious external fellowship to conduct research at Oxford. Started a group in 2000 at London Institute--started PhD at age of a postdoc, so maybe is a part of things.\n",

In terms of homeostasis, once you have a domain like this, if it's important to come back in a homeostatic way, then the gene might be overextended (through drug use or something). Memories of this might keep the gene overextended, leading to the disease. \n"
